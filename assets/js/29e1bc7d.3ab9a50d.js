For all fluorescence measurements you must take a strain with NO fluorophore as background (you will be surprised but yeast have weird auto fluorescent organelles that change in different conditions). For co-localization studies you MUST take strains with each protein tagged individually to check for bleedthrough of the fluorophores. Bleedthrough must be measured separately in each experiment - while there might not be a bleedthrough in one experiment, there might still be in another even though the microscopy settings are the same, because of a protein that is more abundant or with a more concentrated location in the cell which leads to a stronger signal.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"microscopy-high-throughput":{"id":"microscopy-high-throughput","title":"\ud83d\udda5\ufe0f Microscopy & High-Throughput","description":"Please Note: The content below is not a direct copy from the original Word document.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"orders":{"id":"orders","title":"\ud83d\udce6 Orders","description":"- Please add your product name, catalogue number and supplier to the file entitled: \u201clab ordering list\u201d located in \u201cLife in the Schuldiner lab\u201d/ \u201corders\u201d/ \u201clab ordering list\u201d.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"plasmids":{"id":"plasmids","title":"\ud83e\uddec Plasmids","description":"- When getting a new plasmid (from abroad or from Yoav or if you made it) \u2013 always freeze it down as bacterial stocks in the -80 (using the NEBstable competent cells).
