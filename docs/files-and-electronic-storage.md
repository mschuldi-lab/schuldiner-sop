# Files and Electronic Storage

* The password for general lab databases is “Schuldiner”

* When you finish a screen, make a folder with all images from the screen, the screen guide and an Excel spreadsheet of the library coordinates, INSIDE the folder so that you always know which coordinates you used and have the details of the screen handy. The name of the folder in the microscope computer should contain the serial number of the screen (example SMS79), your name and date.  Confirm with Yeynit that the folder is compressed (with the SMS number) and that a copy is saved on the backup hard drive. Fill the names of the hard drives in the 'screen data base' Excel file in the storage column

* Optional: When you finish a screen, change the names of your files to the gene names with the special plugin that we have. This will make it easier to go back to data in the future.

* Have someone explain to you how to use the Excel function "vlookup" or “xlookup” – you will use it a lot! Make sure to use the “FALSE” value in the range_lookup parameter to receive the correct answer. In the newer versions of Excel there is an “XLookUp” option that allows for a specific output if value is not found (i.e., “N/A” or “Error”).


:::note
- Always update your electronic lab notebook (if you do not have one yet ask Maya to open one for you). Insert your thoughts about the experiment you already did and experiments you think about doing in the future. Enter DNA or protein gels results, pictures from the microscope, tables etc. Do this once a week (maybe set a specific day to do it) so that you won’t forget what you did as time passes.
:::



:::note
- when updating your lab notebook make sure to write all details that you will need afterwards for publication – the exact methods you used (with dated protocol), the number of the strain, plasmids, primers that you used etc. If you are not sure ask someone in the lab which details go into thesis/publications later. You can also make a table for all antibodies that you used with dilutions etc.
:::



:::note
- All information on libraries in the lab is in an Excel spreadsheet – please make sure to update any new libraries that you make or obtain, with all relevant info and also update on the sheet when you thaw your libraries.
:::


* Make sure to update any information you have on strains, plasmids, primers and antibodies in the “comments” column in their respective spreadsheet, especially if you know something does not work or is not what it says – share this information with everyone.

* It is YOUR responsibility to make sure that all your data is backed up in at least one other place. It is your choice whether to do this on the cloud (DropboxinSync) or on an external hard disk (to buy an external hard disk ask Hadar/ Hanni). Make sure to back up everything regularly. Also, when you leave you MUST retain a compressed copy of all your lab files in your own possession, in addition to the copy that we will keep in the lab. If you move to live abroad, take it with you for any questions we may have on scientific files while you are not in Israel.


:::note
- Before using the hard disk: Check which formatting it has - if it is “FAT”, change it to “NTFS”! FAT is not good – some of our imaging files contain information that it cannot store and that part will be lost, and the file only be partially functional. Reformatting after data transfer will delete stored data, so do it before. Changing the format can easily be done using the built-in windows function – right-click on harddrive > Format etc.
:::


If you have MAC, it is recommended to ask the IT for formatting so you will be able to use it on PC as well since Eva’s computer works only with PC hard disks. Alternatively, you could purchase a program called “Microsoft NTFS for Mac” by Paragon Software. It may be more reliable and stable (in case something happens to the HD) than the operating system the IT is formatting the HD to.


:::note
- When updating any files on the lab Dropbox in the shared documents, make sure that your Dropbox app is open and synced and that you have the most updated version of the file you want to edit. This will prevent conflicting copies of the file. When you’re done updating, close the file and check that it has been saved and updated in Dropbox and that a conflicting copy was not created.
:::


* Use an external table to insert any information of new plasmid/yeast strain/new primers before copying it to the shared tables in the ‘shared lab folder’. This way the chances of a conflicting copy will be lower.

* Before submitting a manuscript from the lab, you will be required to provide ALL original data for each panel and each figure. It is advised to make sure in advance that you keep all the original data and label it in a way that is easy for you to find later. If you are not sure how to do this talk to Maya.


:::note
- We recommend NOT to call folders or files with a date 1_1_22 etc…It will be very hard for you to find it in the future and impossible for the lab to retrieve data if needed after you leave. Please consider calling files with a name that makes sense AND a date “Lec1PullDowns_1_1_22” for example…
:::


* Sometimes, when doing a backup, the computer might say that the file name or path are too long and will not copy the file. Therefore, try and keep file names and paths to a reasonable size.


:::tip
- It is highly recommended to take an “Illustrator” and “Photoshop” course at the WIS graphics department upon joining the lab. It will allow you to make better quality figures and save you a lot of time in the future. You will also get FGS Credit Points for it. Talk to Maya if you don’t know how to register for one.

* For computational work, image processing and analysis, we have an Excel file listing coded scripts and macros that are available in the lab. Feel free to browse through if there is something that is of use for you and give back by adding an entry if you created something.

* When dealing with large data sets or performing statistical analysis to your data, you might need the help of the institute’s statistician. His details: Dr. Ron Rotkopf +972-8-934-5162 ron.rotkopf@weizmann.ac.il
