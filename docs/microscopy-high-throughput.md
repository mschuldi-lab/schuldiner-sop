# Microscopy & High-Throughput

## Microscopy (General)

:::danger Controls
* **Background:** Strain with NO fluorophore.
* **Bleedthrough:** Strains with single tags (for co-localization).
:::

* **Oil Objective:** Clean with 100% ethanol/isopropanol. Label plates used with oil.
* **Brightfield:** Always take a BF image for segmentation.

## Eva Microscope Startup
:::tip Startup Sequence
1.  **Main Power:** Wait for start-up noises.
2.  **RTC Controller:** Wait for **two beeps**.
3.  **Lasers:** Wait for "Laser Ready" light.
4.  **TPC:** Turn on **before** opening software.
:::

### Troubleshooting Table
| Problem | Solution |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Connectivity** | Restart TPC. Check Tango box (blue light). |
| **Focus** | Clean plate/objective. Check Z-limits (Yeast: 6335µm). |
| **CellSens Issues** | Perform "ScanR-bypass": Close CellSens -> Open/Close ScanR -> Re-open CellSens. |

## Singer & SGA

:::warning Singer Pads
* Put dirty pads **IMMEDIATELY** in bleach. Dried yeast acts like glue.
* Do not overfill washing boxes (pads should not float).
* Check pins before use—dispose of crooked pins.
:::

* **Ordering Plates:** Order 20% more than needed to account for errors.
* **SGA Spores:** Keep SPO plates outside the fridge after replicating. Sporulation is inefficient; you may need to go back to them.
* **Libraries:** If picking from libraries, **always streak to singles**. Perform check PCR.

:::info Library Cards
Use the "library cards" file in the Libraries folder to track missing colonies when refreshing.
