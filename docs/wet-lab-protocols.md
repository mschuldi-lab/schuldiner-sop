# Wet Lab Protocols

## Plasmids & Cloning

:::info Freezing Plasmids
When getting a new plasmid, freeze it as bacterial stocks in the -80 using NEBstable cells.
* Write the number on the **top AND side**.
* Underline the number (e.g., 609 vs 606) to avoid orientation errors.
:::

* **Sequencing:** Use [Plasmidsaurus](https://www.plasmidsaurus.com/). Pickup box is on the 2nd floor (Meyer building).
* **Ordering:** When ordering from Yoav, check the sequence and backbone carefully.

## DNA Gels
:::note Gel Storage
A DNA gel can be kept in liquid for a few hours. For overnight storage, wrap in clingfilm and refrigerate to prevent Gel-Red diffusion.
:::

* **Imaging:** Wipe the tray with Kimwipes (not paper towels) to avoid debris. Move images from the shared Dropbox folder to your personal folder immediately.
* **Disposal:** Clean the bottle with a brush after pouring leftovers.

## Transformations
:::tip Primer Tips
* Check the **SWAT pYM primer collection** before ordering.
* Move SWAT primers to screw-cap tubes.
* If ordering >1000 NIS, notify Hanni.
:::

* **PCR:** If Kapa Hifi fails, try adding 1µl DMSO or use Q5.
* **Colonies:** Always streak to singles. Wait 3 days for negative colonies to stop growing.
* **Controls:** Always use positive and negative controls in PCR.

## Strains & Media
:::danger Strain Expiration
* **G418/Hygro:** 6 months
* **NAT/Amp/Kan:** 1 year
* **5FOA/MTX:** 3 months
:::

* **W303 Strains:** Cannot grow on OMM Amino Acid mix.
* **Freezing:** Use printed stickers for the cap and side. Add a round sticker on the side as backup.

## Western Blots
:::info Antibodies
* Dilute antibodies in **2% BSA/PBS + phenol red**.
* Discard diluted antibodies when they turn yellow or after 1 year.
* **Primary Abs:** Label with Serial #, Dilution, and Date.
:::

* **Blocking:** Do not use milk for streptavidin/anti-phospho blots (use Fish Serum).
* **Membranes:** Can be left in blocking/primary Ab over the weekend (4°C), but **NEVER** in secondary Ab.
* **Transfer:** For proteins >175kDa, use **Wet Transfer** (not semi-dry).
