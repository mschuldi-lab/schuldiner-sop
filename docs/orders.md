- Every week a list of the items that have been ordered by Hanni will be hung on the side of the pipette cabinet in the lab. Please update this list whenever you get any delivery, and if the item is not in the list, then add it manually. Write your name, the location of the product and add a comment when necessary.
:::



:::note
- Place all the documents attached to the deliveries (such as invoices/delivery notes) on Hanni’s desk.

:::note
- A worksheet including all our ongoing ordered items has been added to the “lab ordering list” file. Please add to this list stuff that is ordered on a weekly/monthly basis so that it will be easier to find the details.

:::note
- When you receive an incoming order (brought by delivery people or placed behind Terry’s desk next to the TC room), please do the following three things: 1) If it’s clearly stated, store the item in the designated place in the lab or at -4°C/-20°C (“Inbox” shelf in the common lab fridge and freezer). If not clear what the storage conditions are – put in the 4°C fridge in the hall and send a picture of it to the relevant person who will be responsible to relocate it to the correct storage conditions, 2) bring the paperwork to Hanni’s desk, 3) indicate that it has arrived on the print-out of the lab ordering list hanging on the central shelf where we store our pipette tips (if you can’t find the item on the list, please add it. The list is renewed once a week). 4) If the order is designated to a specific person in the lab, please send them a message notifying them of its arrival so that they know.
