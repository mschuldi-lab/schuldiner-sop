# Plasmids


:::note
- When getting a new plasmid (from abroad or from Yoav or if you made it) – always freeze it down as bacterial stocks in the -80 (using the NEBstable competent cells). Make sure to write the number on the top AND on the side and put a line under it to avoid it being read in the wrong orientation (like 508/805 and 9/6), so it can be identified easily. Please add a comment to it saying “never used”. Once someone uses it successfully for the first time, they should delete this comment.

:::note
- When ordering a plasmid from Yoav please make sure to go over the sequence and make sure it is exactly what you requested and the correct backbone.

* Whenever you freeze a plasmid make sure to save all relevant data in the folder of “Maps and Sequences” with the plasmid number clearly written on it.


:::note
- Please consider sequencing the entire plasmid from the frozen bacterial stock (in case that mutations happened in the bacterial transformation) – we now have an easy way of doing this through https://www.plasmidsaurus.com/. There is an institutional pickup box in the Meyer building on the second floor next to Rotem Sorek’s lab. Plasmidosauros picks it up every Monday and Wednesday. To order sequencing, please refer to the sequencing protocol: Dropbox folder, under “Protocols”->” Sequence a plasmid with SNPsaurus”.
